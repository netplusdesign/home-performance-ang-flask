# charting-performance-ang-flask

Converted [home-performance-ang](https://github.com/netplusdesign/home-performance-ang) to use a new REST API built with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org). 

See [home-performance-flask](https://github.com/netplusdesign/home-performance-flask)

See working prototype at: http://netplusdesign.com/app2/  (if you get an error it's because the server fell asleep. Hit refresh, all should be fine.)
